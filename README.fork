This is my fork for benbjohnson/litestream so I can build releases from
HEAD that instances I'm running can download (the instances won't/don't
have go installed).

The build I do is a static build using musl and the binary is compressed
with xz.  It should be available in
https://github.com/ratrocket/litestream/releases.
